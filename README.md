supervised learning
building a simple model to predict whether a customer is leaving the service (1 for churn, 0 for no churn).

after training the data on a diffrent Classifications models, roandom forest was the best option 
got 0.96 accuracy on the validation dataset with precision above 0.87, recall above 0.82, so i moved
on to prefome the prediction on the test data (after tuning the model) and got 0.95 accuracy.
